# Face Recognition

## A Python-based live face regonition system 

The live face recognition system is a Python-based tool designed to detect faces in real-time using the face-recognition and OpenCV (cv2) libraries. Consisting of three core files, including image_encodings.py, main.py, and compare_face.py, the system extracts facial features from a set of sample images, encodes them, and compares them with live camera input for identification purposes. The main.py file orchestrates the live camera feed, dynamic face comparison, and user-friendly interface for adding new faces on-the-fly. Complemented by a repository of sample images and a face_encodings.npy file storing facial encodings, the system offers a robust solution for real-time face detection and recognition tasks.
